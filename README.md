A highlight collector for XChat2. It logs the past 4 messages, the highlighted message, and the next 4 messages into a tab for the channel highlighted in, to provide context.

The last collector I used collected all highlights into a single channel. In terms of directing me to where highlights occurred and why I was highlighted, it did its charm. However, the next 4 messages for each channel got printed there as well, which became ambiguous when two highlights were received near the same time. The messages would mingle, and I couldn't tell at a glance (unless I knew the nicks) which was meant for which channel.
